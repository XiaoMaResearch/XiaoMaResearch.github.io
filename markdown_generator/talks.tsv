Localization and Instability in Sheared Granular Materials: Role of Pore Fluids and Non-monotonic Rate Dependent Rheology	Talk	talk-1	USNCTAM2018	2018-06-07	Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois	/talks/2018-06-07-talk-1	Fault zone dynamics hold the key to resolving many outstanding geophysical problems including the heat flow paradox, discrepancy between fault static and dynamic strength, and energy partitioning. Most fault zones that generate tectonic events are gouge filled and fluid saturated posing the need for formulating gouge-specific constitutive models that capture spatially heterogeneous compaction and dilation, non-monotonic rate dependence, and transition between localized and distributed deformation. In this presentation, we focus primarily on elucidating microscopic underpinnings for shear banding and stick-slip instabilities in sheared saturated granular materials and explore their implications for earthquake dynamics. We use a non-equilibrium thermodynamics model, the Shear Transformation Zone theory, to investigate the dynamics of strain localization and its connection to stability of sliding in the presence and absence of pore fluids. We also consider the possible influence of self-induced mechanical vibrations as well as the role of external acoustic vibrations as analogue for triggering by a distant event. For the dry case, our results suggest that at low and intermediate strain rates, persistent shear bands develop only in the absence of vibrations. Vibrations tend to fluidize the granular network and de-localize slip at these rates. Stick-slip is only observed for rough grains and it is confined to the shear band. At high strain rates, stick-slip disappears and the different systems exhibit similar stress-slip response. Changing the vibration intensity, duration or time of application alters the system response and may cause long-lasting rheological changes. The presence of pore fluids modifies the stick slip pattern and may lead to both loss and development of slip instability depending on the value of the confining pressure, imposed strain rate and hydraulic parameters. We analyze these observations in terms of possible transitions between rate strengthening and rate weakening response facilitated by a competition between shear induced dilation and acoustic compaction. We discuss the implications of our results on dynamic triggering, quiescence and strength evolution in gouge filled fault zones.

Modeling Dynamic Ruptures with High Resolution Fault Zone Physics.	Presentation	present-1	SCEC Annual Meeting	2018-08-15	USC, LA, California	https://xiaomaresearch.github.io/files/talks/SCEC_Ma2018.pptx	Earthquakes are among the costliest natural hazards on earth. The dynamical instabilities responsible for the onset and propagation of these events are linked to fundamental physics- friction, fracture, heating, and compaction- of fluid filled granular materials and rocks in the subsurface subjected to extreme geophysical conditions. Here, we present a new hybrid computational algorithm for modeling earthquake ruptures in complex fault zone structures. The hybrid method combines Finite element method (FEM) and Spectral boundary integral (SBI) equation through the consistent exchange of displacement and traction boundary conditions, thereby benefiting from the flexibility of FEM in handling problems with nonlinearities or small-scale heterogeneities and from the superior performance and accuracy of SBI. We validate the hybrid method using a benchmark problem from SCEC dynamic rupture simulation validation exercises. We further demonstrate the capability and computational efficiency of the hybrid scheme for resolving off-fault complexities using a first-of-its kind model of a fault zone with explicit representation of small scale secondary faults and branches enabling new insights into earthquake rupture dynamics that may not be realizable in homogenized isotropic plasticity or damage model. For example, we have observed that, for a range of parameters, when the secondary faults are activated they not only act as energy sinks but also as energy source by dynamically loading the main fault enhancing the rupture speed and slip rate of the main fault rupture. Furthermore, the interaction of the emitted waves with the explicitly represented secondary faults and branches lead to interference patterns that complexify the wave field and enhance high frequency generation. These observations enabled by our novel developments in computational dynamic fracture open new opportunities for multiscale modeling of earthquake physics for next generation seismic hazard models.
